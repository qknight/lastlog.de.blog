Have you looked into erp5?

I admire the abstractions made and the discipline to stick to design and coding policies.
Erp5 includes many business templates that can be combined to fit your needs. It is designed to be adapted.

A RESTful interface and automated testing are built-in.

[This paper](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.ex4ever.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/erp5techintro.pdf&ved=0CBsQFjAAahUKEwj1s9bO_fvIAhXIsxQKHRwADNw&usg=AFQjCNFRphjhp7TUaJS2KJaNzBnaN9QBTw&sig2=7OvS9i0JlDowC6E2HYplFQ) is a nice read to learn about the technical background of erp5.
I 'd love to read your conclusion of your evaluation.

I have no running instance of erp5 and I have no connection to the people behind the project. Just a strong interest and admiration.
Googling 'nixos odoo' brought me to your nice blog. Odoo seems a lot easier to implement quickly for an upcoming project but erp5 would be nicer. Nix might be the solution.
