Related thing: steam on nix(os) had to go a bit different way, as steam itself downloads/updates the game binaries, so there's a chroot created that makes the required libs present on places where they would be in a regular distro. I'm unsure if there's a better reference than [an older blog post](http://sandervanderburg.blogspot.nl/2013/09/composing-fhs-compatible-chroot.html).
