nix:

- nix-expression evaluation: each single step is a transaction like step which means that; when doing changes to installPhase, do not evaluate buildPhase again, but instead of use cached values
 - this is already the case for unpackPhase for instance

- serialisierung von nix os systemen oder von nixos services

- virtualisierung des stores
 - use oldversion+binary delta
 - fast boot

- leave out dependencies, record the output and store this on a webserver. why? would be good to have this as a database to suggest fixes for yet unpackages software

- p2p

- hydra: create a incentive in QA for upstream with nice logs: 
 - compile warnings
 - amount of manual patches (the less, the better)
 - meta-data stuff
 - unit tests

- ssh (change session layer from ip:port to a cookie or similar), also resume broken sessions automatically on disconnect or ip change

- tmux remote terminal (so that you can access the server via http://servername/terminal1) but see the same stuff as a user using: screen with screen -X
