# motivation
nixos is all about **custom environments** and **containing application not interfering with each other**. while this is **'the dream'** for the **ops team** it was still unhandy for **dev teams** until now! recent development(s) are about to kick in, setting usability levels to a degree most developers would enjoy.

in this posting i want to outline some of these recent developments related to development environments.

# custom environments
but what is a custom environment? in a nutshell: when you open a shell, you got a environment where you can start programs (**find . -name bar**), export variables (**export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH**);

## makeWrapper / RPATH
## myEnvFun
## nix-shell
## using nix as shebang
