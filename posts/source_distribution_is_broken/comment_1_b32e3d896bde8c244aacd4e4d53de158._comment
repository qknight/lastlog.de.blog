#### lua-sockets
It's typically not hard to find where e.g. Ubuntu, Debian, Arch get sources from. Incidentally, I looked at lua-sockets a few days ago, and IIRC they are taking it from <https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket/releases>.

#### Source+binary distribution
It seems to me that you are looking for a huge content-addressable distributed filesystem that contains everything -- source trees for all released versions, nix binary packages. Of course, it would need lots of clever deduplication and other complications. I'm not aware of any project like that.
